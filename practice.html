     <h1 style="background-color:black;color:floralwhite">how to build <strong>sustainable internal</strong> motivation </h1>
        
        <p1>There is an idea called <strong>SELF-DETERIMINATION</strong> theory that describes three essential needs:</p1>
        <ol>
            <li>autonomy-you need to feel like you are in control of your learning and your goal; when we feel like our actions lead to real change, we are more likely to immerse ourselves in our work.</li>
           <br> 
            <li>competency-you need to feel that you are making progress and you are able to learn the skills and get better; when we feel like we have what takes to succed, we are more likely to show up consistently.</li>
           <br> 
            <li>connection-we need to experience a sense of belonging to other people; if we have the same goals, we can use one another for motivation.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br><br><p1>P.S: We learn because we love to learn, not to escape any punishments or to get any reward.</p1>
